##  Hey   , I'm Ritesh â€” Civil Engineer turned Aspiring Data Scientist

I'm transitioning from civil engineering to solving real-world problems with Data Science and AI. I specialize in using Python to build end-to-end machine learning projects, especially in the engineering and automation space.

 Tools I Use:
Python â€¢ Pandas â€¢ Numpy â€¢ Matplotlib â€¢ Seaborn â€¢ Scikit-learn â€¢ Google Colab â€¢ Streamlit â€¢ OpenAI API

 Current Focus:
- Building portfolio projects from real civil/engineering datasets
- Practicing machine learning algorithms with real business goals
- Posting my journey and learnings on LinkedIn
